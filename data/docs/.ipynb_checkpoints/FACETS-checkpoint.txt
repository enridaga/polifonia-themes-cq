CQ1: Search operations should be expressed on either raw-level features (eg melodic lines) or higher-level features (eg modes, cadences, triad patterns, etc.). The systm should retrieve efficiently all sources that match the search pattern, and identifiy pattern occurrences
CQ3: At each step, the result set takes the form of a subcorpus organized according to rich relationships, and enriched with user annotations
CQ4: A result set can be stored (in intention, not in extension) as a Relevant Corpus, and its definition can be revised at any moment
CQ2: A subset can be hierarchically refined based on criteria independant from on another and independant from the initial search pattern. The user can navigate in this hierarchy and refine the search.
CQ5: navigating through a Relevant Corpus is based on anotation and search patterns
