CQ1: Can we identify a tune (e.g. from an oral tradition) in our collection with music in another documented collection, e.g. RISM, NEUMA, ABC
CQ2: Can we compare music from different collections, e.g. from different countries to show connections/influences between musical styles?
CQ3: Can we compare music longitudinally, e.g. to see evolution of tonality and transition from modal to tonal?  Working either at manuscript of collection level.
CQ4: Can we visualize changes in musical form over time, e.g. transition from modal to tonal (evolution curves - see Weiss et al. 2018 ‘Investigating style evolution of Western classical music: A computational approach’) - with zooming
CQ5: Can we visualize interconnections, e.g. of tunes which share melodic patterns or geographical origin?
